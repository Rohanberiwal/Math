Green's Theorem is applicable to regions that are simply connected, meaning that there are no 
"holes" or voids in the interior of the region. In other words, the region should be connected 
and not have any isolated components or voids that prevent a continuous deformation into a point.

Mathematically, Green's Theorem holds for a region 
D that is simply connected and has a piecewise smooth, positively oriented boundary 
C. If the region has holes or isolated components, Green's Theorem may not apply directly.

If a region has holes, one can apply Green's Theorem to each connected component separately. 
This means breaking down the region into simple, connected pieces and applying the theorem to each piece individually.

If there are holes in the region, the circulation and flux calculations may be affected by the presence of these holes.
In such cases, it's important to account for the contributions from the holes separately.
