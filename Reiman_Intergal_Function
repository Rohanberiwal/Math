The Riemann Integral is a mathematical concept used to calculate the integral of a function over a closed interval. It's one of the fundamental concepts in calculus. The Riemann Integral of a function 

 f(x)dx.

There are two main types of Riemann Integrals:

Definite Integral: This represents the signed area between the curve of the function and the x-axis over the given interval. The definite integral is a number that quantifies the "accumulated" effect of the function over the interval.
​
 f(x)dx

Indefinite Integral (Antiderivative): This is the reverse process of differentiation. The indefinite integral of a function 

f(x) is another function 
F(x) (usually with a "+ C" constant) such that 

F(x)=f(x).

∫f(x)dx=F(x)+C

Riemann Integrals are often computed using various techniques, such as the Riemann sum, which approximates the integral using a finite number of partitions (rectangles or trapezoids). As the number of partitions increases, the approximation becomes more accurate and approaches the true integral.

Riemann Integrals are essential tools in calculus for calculating quantities like area under a curve, total accumulated change, and various physical and engineering applications. The concept forms the basis for many other integral definitions and techniques in mathematics.
