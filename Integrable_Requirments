Boundedness: The function should be bounded over the interval of interest. This means that there should be upper and lower bounds 
for the function's values within the interval. A function that doesn't have these bounds may not be integrable.

Finite Discontinuities: If the function has discontinuities within the interval
, they should be finite in number and magnitude. Isolated discontinuities (e.g., jump discontinuities) are typically acceptable, but essential singularities or infinite discontinuities can make a function non-integrable.

Piecewise Continuity: If the function is not continuous
at certain points within the interval, it should be piecewise continuous. This means it can be divided into a finite number of subintervals where it is continuous except possibly at the endpoints of those subintervals.

Limit Behavior: The function should have well-defined limits at the endpoints of the interval,
meaning that the limits as you approach the endpoints from within the interval exist and are finite.

Lebesgue Integrability: In more advanced contexts, you may encounter the Lebesgue Integral,
which extends the concept of integrability to a broader class of functions. A function that might not be Riemann integrable could still be Lebesgue integrable.

Keep in mind that the conditions for integrability can vary between Riemann 
integrability, Lebesgue integrability, and other types of integrability, so the context and specific requirements matter.
