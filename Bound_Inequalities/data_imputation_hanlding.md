## Markov's Inequality

**Statement**: For a non-negative random variable \( X \) and \( a > 0 \):
\[ P(X \geq a) \leq \frac{E[X]}{a} \]

**Significance**: Provides an upper bound on the probability that a non-negative random variable is greater than or equal to a certain value based on its expected value.

---

## Chebyshev's Inequality

**Statement**: For any random variable \( X \) with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \), and for any \( k > 0 \):
\[ P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2} \]

**Significance**: It quantifies the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean and is particularly useful when the distribution of \( X \) is unknown.

---

## Chernoff Bounds

**Statement**: For independent random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) with means \( \mu_i \):
- For the upper tail:
\[ P(S \geq (1+\delta)E[S]) \leq e^{-\frac{\delta^2 E[S]}{2 + \delta}} \]
- For the lower tail:
\[ P(S \leq (1-\delta)E[S]) \leq e^{-\frac{\delta^2 E[S]}{2}} \]

where \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \).

**Significance**: Provides exponentially decreasing bounds on the tail distributions of sums of independent random variables, making it useful in algorithms and performance analysis.

## Hoeffding's Inequality

**Statement**: Let \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) be independent random variables such that \( a_i \leq X_i \leq b_i \). Then for the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \):
\[ P(S - E[S] \geq t) \leq e^{-\frac{2t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(b_i - a_i)^2}} \]

**Significance**: A powerful inequality that gives a bound on the probability of deviation from the expected value for bounded independent random variables.

---

## Bernstein's Inequality

**Statement**: For independent random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \) with \( |X_i - E[X_i]| \leq b \):
\[ P(S - E[S] \geq t) \leq e^{-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma^2 + bt/3}} \]
where \( \sigma^2 = \text{Var}[S] \).

**Significance**: It improves upon Hoeffding's inequality by incorporating the variance of the random variables.

## Applications

- **Statistical Analysis**: These inequalities are used to derive bounds for estimators and test statistics.
- **Machine Learning**: They help in understanding the convergence and generalization properties of algorithms.
- **Computer Science**: Used in the analysis of randomized algorithms and data structures.
