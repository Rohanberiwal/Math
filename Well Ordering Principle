The Well-Ordering Principle is a fundamental concept in set theory
that states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a least element.
In other words, any set of positive integers must contain a smallest element.

However, the Well-Ordering Principle, as typically formulated, specifically refers 
to well-ordering of sets of positive integers and doesn't directly apply to negative integers or other types of sets.

For negative integers or other types of sets, the concept of well-ordering doesn't hold
in the same way. The set of negative integers, for example, does not have a least element 
because you can always find a more negative integer.

In general, the Well-Ordering Principle is a property of certain sets, and it doesn't 
universally apply to all types of sets, especially those with no minimum element.
