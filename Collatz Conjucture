Collatz - Conjuecture  

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. 
The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. 
It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even
the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start the sequence.

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

If the number is even, divide it by two.
If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

If the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting number which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1.
Such a sequence would either enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without bound. No such sequence has been found.

The smallest i such that ai < a0 is called the stopping time of n. 
The smallest k such that ak = 1 is called the total stopping time of n .
The Collatz conjecture asserts that the total stopping time of every n is finite.

Syracuse function : An optimisation for the collatz conjecture .

If k is an odd integer, then 3k + 1 is even, so 3k + 1 = 2ak′ with k′ odd and a ≥ 1. 
The Syracuse function is the function f from the set I of positive odd integers into itself, for which f(k) = k′

Properties of Syracuse Function : 
1.>For all k ∈ I, f(4k + 1) = f(k)
2.>In more generality: For all p ≥ 1 and odd h, f^(p − 1)(2^(p)*(h − 1) = 2 × 3^(p − 1)*(h − 1). Where  f^(p − 1) is function iteration notation
3.> For all odd h, f(2h − 1) ≤ 3h-1 / 2 .

The Collatz conjecture is equivalent to the statement that, for all k in I, there exists an integer n ≥ 1 such that f^(n)(k) = 1.
